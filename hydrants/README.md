Via this initiative, the various stakeholders propose to semantically model the different data flows and standardize the structure of the data for the following subject:
-	Extinguishing water sources
    -	Hydrants (underground & above-ground)
    -	Water supply in the form of basins, wells, and other sources
-	PEB/PPB (Point of First Destination) for the emergency services to assemble at first spot
-	Measuring points for dangerous substances during incidents. 
-	Major electricity transportation networks (capacities, voltage, dependencies, switches, â€¦)
-	Transport pipelines

The focus is on terms related to __extinguishing water sources__. We start from terms defined for these entities in the existing __extinguishing water source Registers__.

The objective is to make the data accessible as Linked Open Data and to define standard interfaces (APIs) in order to simplify collaboration and integration of the various services and tools. The objective is to make the data easily reusable for all stakeholders.
