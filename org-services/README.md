# ICEG Public Organisation and Public Service

## Context
Via this initiative, the various stakeholders wish to semantically model the different data flows and standardize the structure of the data for the subject public organisation (Any organization that is defined as being part of the public sector by a legal framework at any level) and public services. We start from terms defined for these entities in existing standards at regional and federal level.

The objective is to make the data accessible as Linked Open Data and to define standard interfaces (APIs) in order to simplify collaboration and integration of the various services and tools. The purpose is to make the data easily reusable for all stakeholders.

## Scope
The objective of the business workshop is to map, define and standardize information related to public organization and services. Based on our use cases the scope will be defined.
The following concepts are within the scope:
- Public organisation
- Public service
In the business workshop, we will evaluate the different use cases of the stakeholders to determine the detail scope.

## Target audience
Anyone who would like to contribute to a standard for the exchange of data for public organisations or public services.
 
## Practical
For this process, we plan a business workshop and 4 thematic workshops. All workshops proceed virtually via Microsoft Teams.
