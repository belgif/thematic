# Interoperability Assessments

The Interoperable Europe Acts wants Member States to publish interoperability assessments of tools / services, but does not provide a template (yet ?).

Moreover, a machine-friendly version should be published as well, so a RDF representation would come in handy.
Would also be useful to be able to upload this automatically to semic/interoperable europe website

Initial thoughts 
- ADMS 2.0 ?
- EU Publication Office list of EIF recommendations ?

What should be in it ?
- date
- publisher (org.vocab.be URI)
- solution type (service ?)
- license ?
- contact (email)
